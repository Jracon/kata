## does fractional money exist?
Fractional money only really exists insofar as it is needed. We do not deal with anything less than pennies (in the US), until it comes time to divide a price or multiply an item that technically costs less than a penny to produce (due to price division for material/labor). 

## when (if ever) does rounding take place?
Rounding generally only ever takes place when fractional money is involved. If an item is $99$¢/lb, and I get $1/2$lb, that price should technically be $99¢/2 = 49.5¢$. Since we do not have anything to represent less than a penny in the current monetary system, that price is then rounded (most likely up using the common rule of rounding up if the decimal is $>= .5$, down else). Thinking further, rounding can take place in other situations, albeit only in situations where it is not required by the limits of our money. You could round a price up or down for a charity, or by tipping, or to make the number on the receipt nice and even, but this is not "true" rounding.

## how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
Simply having a record of all transactions would likely be sufficient, but only under the circumstances of maintaining a codified set of pricing decisions. I see no scenarios in which a pricing decision would have to be made on the spot, without some rule already backing up the logic. Thus, I believe that a trail of price decisions is unnecessary.

## are costs and prices the same class of thing?
Costs and prices are generally synonyms, both meaning the amount of value something carries and can be exchanged for. Beyond that, without further defining both "class" and "thing", I cannot say.

## if a shelf of 100 cans is priced using “buy two, get one free”, how do you value the stock?
The value of a stock (of items) is not necessarily a static value. Before the "buy two, get one free" promotion was implemented (or while the stock was purchased), the stock was likely valued at some value per item, or some value per set of items. While the promotion is active, that stock still retains that same value, as its inherent value has not changed. If I purchase just 1 item, that value per item is still intact, unaffected by the promotion. However, promotions are usually efforts to sell more stock than originally predicted, or to sell off excess. If a store wants to encourage people to buy something that would not have sold anyways, its value is lower to that store, and the stock should probably be evaluated as such.
