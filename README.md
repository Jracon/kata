This is a collection of Code Katas I have completed, in order to test myself and my ways of thinking. Katas are sorted by origin first and then the individual kata, usually denoted by a number. Those individual katas generally contain some Markdown files, (potentially some data for the prompt), and 1 (or more) folders. The Markdown files are one "Prompt" file, which details the prompt behind the kata, and one (or more) "Thoughts" file(s), which details my thoughts on the individual kata, and the process associated with solving it. (Multiple "Thoughts" files are denoted with a (Rev-X)). The folders are each for a different programming language. Inside those folders are the required files for the kata in that programming language.
